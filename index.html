  <h1>Background</h1>
  <p>I'm living in Southern California where people always happy when they see the rain. We are suffering a really bad drough in recent years. I graduated from University of California with a B.S degree in computer science. Upon graduation, I intern at EMC Coorporation. One day, a QA manager offered me an QA position in his team. For me, i didn't know much about how QA Engineer was at that time because I was intern for a development team. Therefore, I accepted the offer and end up as a Software QA Engineer. </p>
  With a background in Computer Science and experience from testing, I can adapt and quicly pickup any new technologies.
